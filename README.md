# CandyDefense
A simple C++ SFML Tower Defense project.
The Candy Defense game is a classic game of the Tower Defense genre, in which the player must wisely manage money by strategically deploying turrets that shoot missiles at enemies to stop incoming waves of incoming enemies, from which the player will receive money. From the user interface, it will be possible to select the necessary turrets and deploy them on the appropriate fields. The opponents move their designated path fields and when they reach the end of the path, the player loses health points. Every wave the opponents get tougher, while the player gets stronger turrets at his disposal, allowing him to survive the next waves. The game ends 
at the moment of completing all waves on one of the boards or losing all health points. Three difficulty levels will be available, where the amount of money received per opponent and the number/health of opponents will change. All packed in some nice looking graphics, added a little bit music and hopefully you will enjoy playing it!
